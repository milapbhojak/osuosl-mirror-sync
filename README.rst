OSUOSL Mirror Sync
==================

This is the repository for the OSUOSL Mirror syncing scripts. Documentation is
found in the ``docs/source``.

Building the docs
-----------------

1. virtualenv venv
2. source venv/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. cd docs
4. make html
5. firefox build/html/index.html

.. note:: To later disable the virtualenv, run 'deactivate' or close
          your shell.

NOTE
----

Much of this system is undocumented unfortunately but we are working on fixing
that.
